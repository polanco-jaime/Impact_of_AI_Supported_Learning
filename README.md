**Title:** The Impact of AI-Supported Learning on Financial Literacy: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial

**Abstract:** We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the impact of AI on financial literacy among Belgian secondary students. Students were randomly assigned to traditional instruction (control), AI-supplemented traditional materials, or a tailored AI chatbot. Preliminary results show that the tailored AI chatbot leads to a 10% of SD increase (*p* < 0.01) in financial literacy scores, with a sustained effect two months after learning. This effect is stronger for students with lower pre-existing financial literacy. Our findings suggest AI offers a promising solution for addressing challenges in education, such as the need for personalized instruction and effective knowledge transfer, as demonstrated in the context of financial literacy.
